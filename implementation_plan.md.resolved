# Modern Greeting Web Application

This plan outlines the creation of a visually attractive, modern greeting web application that dynamically says hello to the user and triggers one of three randomized animations (Confetti, Party Popper, Glowing Burst) upon clicking the "Greet" button.

## Proposed Changes

### Greeting Application
The project will be built using Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS to keep it lightweight while ensuring a premium design aesthetic (e.g., glassmorphism, gradient backgrounds).

#### [NEW] [index.html](file:///C:/Users/arund/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/greeting-app/index.html)
- Clean, semantic HTML structure.
- Input field with placeholder, "Greet" button, and greeting message container.
- Includes a canvas element for the animations.

#### [NEW] [style.css](file:///C:/Users/arund/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/greeting-app/style.css)
- Visually attractive premium dark mode design.
- Centered layout using CSS Flexbox.
- Modern font, smooth transitions, and glowing effects for the burst animation.

#### [NEW] [script.js](file:///C:/Users/arund/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/greeting-app/script.js)
- Event listener for the "Greet" button.
- Logic to display `Hello <Name>`.
- Randomizer to select one of 3 animations (Confetti, Party Popper, Glowing Burst) using `canvas-confetti` and custom CSS classes.
- Ensures animations clear before the next one runs.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- This is a frontend UI prototype, so visual testing will be done in the browser. No unit tests are needed.

### Manual Verification
- Open `index.html` in the browser.
- Verify the UI is centered, features a glassmorphism style, and looks modern.
- Type a name and click "Greet".
- Verify "Hello <Name>" appears dynamically.
- Verify one of the three random animations plays.
- Click multiple times to ensure animations clear properly and don't overlap visually.
