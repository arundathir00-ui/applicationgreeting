# Modern Greeting Web Application

A visually appealing, modern web application that dynamically greets users with randomized, center-focused animations.

## Features

  - Confetti blast (using canvas-confetti)
  - Side-firing Party Popper
  - Custom Glowing Physics Burst
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts perfectly to mobile and desktop screens.
- **Micro-interactions**: Smooth hover transitions, error shaking validation, and floating text effects.

1. Simply clone or download the repository.
2. Open index.html directly in any modern web browser.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
